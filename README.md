# code-theory

block is a library designed to study and visualize encodings and their interactions under rotation and translation.

## Key Components

1. **Block Class**: Encapsulates tensor data with polarity information for calculating attraction between blocks.
2. **Plotting Functions**: Include `plot_faces` for visualizing tensor faces with polarities, and `plot_attraction_vs_rotation_for_multiple_N` to analyze attraction vs rotation angles.
3. **Utility Functions**: Convert tensors to points using `tensor_to_points`.
